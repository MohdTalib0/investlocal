## Deployment Strategy

### Development Setup
- Vite development server for frontend with HMR
- Express server with middleware for API routes
- Database migrations using Drizzle Kit
- Environment variable configuration for database connection

### Production Build
- Vite builds optimized React bundle to `dist/public`
- esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- Static file serving from Express for production deployment
- Database provisioning required with `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### File Structure
- `/client`: React frontend application
- `/server`: Express backend API
- `/shared`: Shared TypeScript types and database schema
- `/migrations`: Database migration files generated by Drizzle Kit

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between frontend, backend, and shared code, making it suitable for deployment on platforms that support full-stack Node.js applications.
